//1. Declare a variable named "euroCities" and assign an array to the variable e.g. ["Paris", "London", "Valletta", "Prague", "Rome"]. Declare another variable and assign the second item of the array as a value.

const euroCities = ["Paris", "London", "Valletta", "Prague", "Rome"];
let secondItem = euroCities[1];
console.log(euroCities);
console.log(secondItem);

//2. Change the first item in the array to "Berlin".

euroCities[0] = "Berlin";
console.log(euroCities);

//3. Print the length of the array "euroCities".

console.log(euroCities.length);

//4. Remove the last item of the array "euroCities".

euroCities.pop();
console.log(euroCities);

//5. Use an array method to add "Budapest" to the euroCities array.

euroCities.push("Budapest");
console.log(euroCities);

//6. Bonus: Remove the second and third items from the euroCities array.

euroCities.splice(1, 2);
console.log(euroCities);

//7. Create another variable named asianCities and assign an array of at least 5 cities to the variable.
const asianCities = ["Taipei", "Tbilisi", "Bangkok", "Kathmandu", "Socotra"];

//8. Bonus: Use an array method to select items 2-4 from the array of asianCities and store this in another variable.

let newAsian = asianCities[1]+ ", " + asianCities[2] + ", " + asianCities[3];
console.log(newAsian);

let newAsian2 = asianCities.slice(1) + asianCities.slice(5);

//9. Bonus: Use a method to concat euroCities with asianCities. Store the result in a variable (eg. worldCities).

let worldCities = euroCities.concat(asianCities); 
console.log(worldCities);

//10. Reverse the order of worldCities.

worldCities.reverse();

// 11 .Bonus: Replace the 3rd item in the array of worldCities with "Toronto".

worldCities[2] = "Toronto";
console.log(worldCities);


// 12 . Bonus: Remove no elements from the array of worldCities, but insert "Washington" at the 2nd position.

worldCities.splice(1, 0, "Washington");
console.log(worldCities);

// 13. Bonus Write a program to join all elements of the result (worldCities) into a string. Example: worldCities = ["Berlin", "London", "Bangkok", "Phnom Penh"]; Expected Outputs: "Berlin , London, Bangkok, Phnom Penh" "Berlin+London+Bangkok+Phnom Penh"
