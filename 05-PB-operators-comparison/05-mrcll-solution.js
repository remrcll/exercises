// 0. Declare two variables "x" and "y". Assign a value of 20 to x. Assign a value of 30 to y.

let x = 20;
let y = 30;

// 1. Check whether x and y are equal.

console.log("1. answer: " + (x === y));

// 2. Check whether x and y are not equal.

console.log("2. answer: " + (x !== y));

// 3. Check whether x is greater than y.

console.log("3. answer: " + (x > y));

// 4. Check whether x is less than or equal to y.

console.log("4. answer: " + (x <= y));

// 5. Check whether y is greater than x.

console.log("5. answer: " + (x < y));

// 6. Declare another variable "z" and give it a value of 5. Multiply z and x, and check whether this result is greater than z added to y.

let z = 5;

console.log("6. answer: " + ((z * x) > (z + y)));

// 7. Subtract z from x and check whether this result is less than y divided by z.

console.log("7. answer: " + ((z - x) < (y / z)));

// 8. Check whether z, x and y are equal.

console.log("8. answer: " + (z === x === y));

// 9. Check whether the remainder of x divided by z and the remainder of y divided by z are equal.

console.log("9. answer: " + ((x % z) === (y % z)));

// 10. Check whether z added to x is greater than y minus z. If it is not, find an operator which will give a result of true.

console.log("10.1. answer: " + (x > (y - z)));
console.log("10.2. answer: " + (x < (y - z)));
